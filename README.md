# HashMaps


src/com/company/HashMapChaining.java contains my hashmap that uses chaining to resolve collisions
 
On average, it takes O(1) time to find the LinkedList to insert and remove a string since it can be found by accessing
the index using the hash key
 
However, on average it takes O(n) time to traverse through the linked list to find the tail node to insert or the right node
to delete
 
operations:

insert -> insert a new value

remove -> remove specified value

print -> print hash map with index and value
